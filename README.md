# binary_tree_simulation
  A quick and fun visualization of binary search trees using flocking and spring forces

### something to note: this code is bad
Due to my lack of foresight and the way processing leaves everything in the global scope, this code is very "smelly"\
This project was just a bit of fun though, so I am not too bothered by it
